An end-to-end, enterprise-grade **National Scholarship Application, Multi-Level Institutional Scrutiny, Sanction Order Generation, and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Disbursement Tracking Platform** built on the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React 18, Node.js).

The architecture is engineered as a **distributed multi-portal system**, orchestrating the scholarship lifecycle across **4 independent role-specific client portals** powered by a unified Express REST API backend:

| Portal | URL & Port | Target User Role | Key Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🏛️ **Institute Portal** | `http://localhost:3000` | `INSTITUTE_OFFICER` | College-level nodal scrutiny, admission & academic verification, defect/rejection management |
| 🎓 **Student Portal** | `http://localhost:3001` | `STUDENT` | Scheme discovery, 5-step application wizard, live milestone tracker, DBT bank ledger |
| 🏢 **Department Portal** | `http://localhost:3002` | `DEPARTMENT_OFFICER` | Ministry/State quota evaluation, Sanction Order generation, DBT payment batch processing |
| ⚙️ **Central Admin Portal** | `http://localhost:3003` | `ADMIN` / `SUPER_ADMIN` | Executive KPI control room, scheme builder, department/college onboarding, RBAC, immutable audit trail |
| 🌐 **Backend API Server** | `http://localhost:5000` | All Clients / Services | REST API, JWT auth, MongoDB transactional models, automated E2E lifecycle workflows |

## ⚡ Getting Started & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: v9.0.0 or higher
- **MongoDB**: Local MongoDB instance running on `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` or MongoDB Atlas URI.
- **Gmail Account or SMTP Relay**: Required for real email delivery (standard Gmail App Password).

---

### 1. Backend Server Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Verify or create the `.env` configuration file in `server/.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/national_scholarship_details
   JWT_SECRET=national_scholarship_secret_key_2026_jwt
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Service Level Performance (SLP) Engine
   SLP_MODE=DEMO

   # Automated Sanction Order Email Dispatch (Gmail SMTP)
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=465
   SMTP_SECURE=true
   SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_gmail_app_password
   MAIL_FROM="National Scholarship Portal <your_email@gmail.com>"
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="National Scholarship Portal"
   STUDENT_PORTAL_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

4. Start the backend API server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Or with nodemon for live reload:
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The API server will listen on `http://localhost:5000`.*

---

### 2. Multi-Portal Client Setup

Each portal is an independent React application configured to run on its dedicated port. Open separate terminal tabs for each portal you wish to launch:

#### A. Institute Officer Portal (Port 3000)
```bash
cd client-institute
npm install
npm start
```
*Access at: `http://localhost:3000`*

#### B. Student Portal (Port 3001)
```bash
cd client-student
npm install
npm start
```
*Access at: `http://localhost:3001`*

#### C. Department Officer Portal (Port 3002)
```bash
cd client-dept
npm install
npm start
```
*Access at: `http://localhost:3002`*

#### D. Central Administrator Portal (Port 3003)
```bash
cd client-admin
npm install
npm start
```
*Access at: `http://localhost:3003`*

> [!TIP]
> Each client repository already contains a `.env` file declaring its specific `PORT` (`3000`, `3001`, `3002`, `3003`), ensuring all 4 portals run simultaneously without port collisions.

---

### 3. Database Initialization & Seeding

To quickly initialize the database with master accredited institutions, funding departments with budgets, active scholarship schemes, and administrative accounts:

## ⚡ Service Level Performance (SLP) & SLA Escalation Engine

The National Scholarship System features an integrated **Service Level Performance (SLP) & SLA Escalation Engine** designed to ensure accountability, transparency, and timely processing across all scrutiny stages.

### Demo Mode vs. Production Mode

The platform employs a centralized configuration (`server/config/slpConfig.js` and `.env`) to toggle between demonstration evaluation and real-world deployment without modifying business logic:

| Parameter | Demonstration Mode (`SLP_MODE=DEMO`) | Production Mode (`SLP_MODE=PRODUCTION`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Fast, observable SLA demonstration in live viva/presentation | Real-world administrative processing |
| **SLA Duration Per Stage** | **60 Seconds (1 Minute)** | **7 Days (604,800 Seconds)** |
| **Warning Threshold** | **45 Seconds (75% elapsed)** | **5.25 Days (75% elapsed)** |
| **Heartbeat Frequency** | **Every 2.5 seconds** | **Every 1 hour** |
| **UI Banner** | Displays `"⚡ Demo Mode — SLA: 1 minute"` across all portals | Displays standard enterprise SLA label |

> **Configuration Note:** Never hardcode SLA durations. The environment variable `SLP_MODE=DEMO` (default in development) automatically configures all backend calculators, ticker intervals, and UI status banners across all 4 portals.

---

### SLA State Lifecycle & Visual Identifiers

Each application processing stage is tracked by an active SLA timer. Timers progress through four clearly styled visual states:

```
[ WITHIN_SLA (0-44s) ] ──> [ SLA_WARNING (45-59s) ] ──> [ SLA_BREACHED (>60s) ] ──> [ COMPLETED_AFTER_SLA ]
       (Blue)                       (Yellow)                    (Amber / Yellow)              (Slate Gray)
```

| SLA State | Timing Threshold | UI Badge & Card Color | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`WITHIN_SLA`** | Elapsed < 75% of SLA | 🔵 Blue (`#2563eb` / `#3b82f6`) | Active processing within normal timeframe |
| **`SLA_WARNING`** | 75% ≤ Elapsed < 100% | 🟡 Yellow (`#eab308`) | Near-breach warning prompt for responsible officer |
| **`SLA_BREACHED`** | Elapsed ≥ 100% (Overdue) | 🟡 **Amber / Yellow Alert** (`#f59e0b` / `#fbbf24`) | **SLA DELAYED**: Escalated to Central Admin Dashboard |
| **`COMPLETED_WITHIN_SLA`** | Completed on time | 🟢 Green (`#16a34a`) | Successfully verified within allotted SLA |
| **`COMPLETED_AFTER_SLA`** | Completed after breach | 🔘 Slate (`#475569`) | Verified with recorded delay; resets timer for next stage |

> ⚠️ **Design Principle — Color Standards:**
> - **Yellow / Amber** is strictly reserved for **SLA Delayed / Breached** and **Warning** states.
> - **Red** is strictly reserved for **Rejected** applications.
> - **Green** represents **Approved / Disbursed / Completed**.
> - **Blue** represents **In-Progress within SLA**.

---

### Zero-Disruption Escalation Principle

When an SLA breach occurs (>60s in Demo Mode):
1. **NO Auto-Approval / Auto-Rejection:** An application is **never** automatically approved or rejected due to a timeout.
2. **NO Stage Skipping:** The processing stage remains strictly at its current state (e.g., remains in Institute Queue or Department Queue).
3. **Escalation Notification:** An automated escalation alert is delivered to the Central Administrator's notification feed.
4. **Audit Trail Recording:** An immutable audit log (`SLP_SLA_BREACHED`) records the elapsed duration, target SLA, officer name, and timestamp.
5. **Officer Resolution:** When the responsible officer eventually reviews and approves the delayed application:
   - The stage history permanently notes `COMPLETED_AFTER_SLA`.
   - The application advances to the subsequent stage (e.g., `ROUTED_TO_DEPARTMENT`).
   - A **brand new 60-second SLA countdown** initiates fresh for the next stage officer.

---

### Central Admin SLP Monitor Dashboard (`/admin/slp`)

Available on the Central Admin Portal at `http://localhost:3003/admin/slp`:
- **6 Real-Time KPI Cards:** Total Active SLAs, Within SLA, SLA Warning, SLA Breached, Escalated, and Central Admin Attention Required.
- **Active SLA Ledger:** Real-time table displaying Application Number, Student, Scheme, Current Processing Stage, Responsible Officer, Elapsed Time, Overdue Duration, and SLA Status.
- **Filterable Controls:** Quick filter by Stage (`SUBMITTED`, `ROUTED_TO_DEPARTMENT`, `APPROVED`, `SANCTIONED`, `PAYMENT_PROCESSING`) and SLA Status (`WITHIN_SLA`, `SLA_WARNING`, `SLA_BREACHED`).
- **Interactive Deep-Dive Modal:** Side-by-side inspection of an application with full milestone timeline, elapsed history, and officer remarks.

## 📧 Automated Sanction Order Email & PDF Dispatch System

The National Scholarship System features a statutory, end-to-end **Automated Sanction Order Email & PDF Dispatch System** engineered to provide transparent, tamper-evident notification to students upon scholarship sanctioning.

### Dedicated Workflow Trigger & Stage Isolation

In strict accordance with government workflow integrity, the email dispatch engine is **isolated exclusively to Stage 4 (SANCTIONED)**:

```
[ Institute Scrutiny ] ──> [ Department Approval ] ──> [ Sanction Order Created ]
                                                                   ↓
                                                     ┌───────────────────────────┐
                                                     │  AUTOMATED EMAIL TRIGGER  │
                                                     │  • Generate Statutory PDF │
                                                     │  • Connect Gmail SSL:465  │
                                                     │  • Dispatch with PDF      │
                                                     │  • Audit in EmailLog      │
                                                     └───────────────────────────┘
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Stage Isolation Policy:**
> - Email dispatch is triggered **ONLY** when a Department Nodal Officer issues an official Sanction Order.
> - **NO emails are dispatched** for Application Submission, Institute Verification, Correction Requests, Rejections, DBT Payment Processing, Disbursement, or SLA Breaches.
> - **Fault-Tolerant Isolation:** If the mail server or network experiences a transient failure, the failure is caught, logged in `EmailLog` as `FAILED (SMTP_ERROR)`, and **never rolls back or disrupts** the database sanction order or department workflow.

---

### Government-Styled PDF Sanction Order Generation

Upon sanction approval, the server invokes the `pdfService` (powered by `pdfkit`) to dynamically compile an official, statutory Sanction Order document saved to `server/uploads/sanctions/Sanction_Order_[SanctionNumber].pdf`:

- **Statutory National Header**: Government emblem branding, Ministry/Department name, and State Nodal Directorate authority.
- **Reference Metadata**: Unique statutory Sanction Number (e.g. `SAN-2026-510607`), Sanction Order Date, and Application Number.
- **Beneficiary Details**: Student Name, Registered Email Address, Institute/College Affiliation, and Course Details.
- **Financial Allotment Table**: Sanctioned Scheme Name, Academic Year, and Approved Scholarship Grant Amount formatted in INR (`₹`).
- **DBT Banking Compliance**: Beneficiary Bank Name, Masked Account Number, and IFSC verification note.
- **Digital Authenticity Stamp**: Embedded nodal officer signature box, digital authorization timestamp, and verification badge.

---

### Nodemailer SMTP Architecture & Gmail SSL Configuration

The email engine in `server/services/emailService.js` manages SMTP handshakes with enterprise resilience:

1. **Port & Security Configuration**:
   - **Port 465**: Enforces SSL (`secure: true`).
   - **Port 587**: Enforces STARTTLS (`secure: false`).
2. **Gmail App Password Handling**:
   - Strips incidental whitespace from 16-character Google App Passwords automatically (`replace(/\s+/g, '')`).
3. **Pre-Flight Handshake Verification**:
   - Executes `await transporter.verify()` before attempting mail transport, validating credentials and server availability with explicit console telemetry:
     ```text
     ====================================================
     [SANCTION EMAIL]
     Recipient: kowsalya.bt23@bitsathy.ac.in
     Subject: Scholarship Sanction Approved — SAN-2026-510607
     PDF: uploads\sanctions\Sanction_Order_SAN-2026-510607.pdf
     SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
     SMTP Port: 465

     [SMTP]
     Connection: SUCCESS

     [EMAIL]
     Message ID: <4dd2c251-3eb7-ba57-67bb-4a30814a88b0@gmail.com>
     Accepted: [ 'kowsalya.bt23@bitsathy.ac.in' ]
     Rejected: []
     Response: 250 2.0.0 OK 1791362204 - gsmtp
     ====================================================
     ```
4. **Real Delivery Guarantee**:
   - The system checks `info.accepted` and `info.rejected` arrays returned by the SMTP relay.
   - The status is marked as `SENT` **only** if the recipient address is present in `info.accepted` and absent from `info.rejected`.
   - Never fakes delivery; any error updates `EmailLog` to `FAILED` with exact `errorCode` and `errorMessage`.

---

### Central Admin Email Dispatch Monitor & Live Retry

Administrators have full oversight of all automated emails via the **Central Admin Portal** (`http://localhost:3003/admin/email-logs`):

| UI Column | Data Rendered | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Date & Time** | Localized timestamp | Timestamp when the dispatch was initiated |
| **Student** | Beneficiary Full Name | Applicant name as recorded in application |
| **Application Number** | `APP-2026-XXXXXX` | Clickable reference link |
| **Sanction Number** | `SAN-2026-XXXXXX` | Statutory Sanction Reference ID |
| **Recipient Email** | Student Email Address | Verified student destination inbox |
| **Email Status** | `SENT` / `FAILED` / `PENDING` | Color-coded badge with hover tooltip displaying failure reason if failed |
| **Attachment** | `Sanction_Order_SAN-XXXX.pdf` | Direct link to preview or download the generated PDF |
| **Actions** | `🔄 RETRY EMAIL` | One-click button to re-trigger real SMTP delivery |

#### One-Click Retry Engine
When an administrator clicks **RETRY EMAIL** for a failed dispatch:
1. The server fetches the `EmailLog` entry and verifies the PDF attachment on disk (auto-regenerates if missing).
2. Increments `retryCount`.
3. Re-dispatches the email through Nodemailer with the real PDF attachment.
4. Updates the record in MongoDB to `SENT`, saving the new `messageId`, `smtpResponse`, and clearing previous errors.

---

### Statutory Sanction Email Template

The applicant receives a formal, high-impact HTML notification containing:
- **Ministry Banner**: Official National Scholarship System header and emblem styling.
- **Congratulatory Notice**: Formal sanction announcement addressed directly to the student.
- **Detailed Summary Box**: Scheme Name, Sanction Number, Sanction Date, and Approved Grant Amount in Indian Rupees.
- **Attachment Notice**: Informs the student that the legal, digitally signed Sanction Order PDF is attached for official records and college bursar submissions.
- **Security Notice**: Clear guidance emphasizing that scholarship funds are credited exclusively through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and officers will never solicit OTPs or banking PINs.

---

## 🧪 Automated Verification & Test Suites

The `server` directory contains comprehensive automated verification scripts that test the entire multi-portal lifecycle programmatically:

### 1. Automated Sanction Email & Statutory PDF Test Suite (`test_sanction_email_workflow.js`)
Validates the complete Sanction Order generation, PDF compilation, SMTP email dispatch, and Admin retry lifecycle:
- Registers a real student account and submits an application for an active scheme.
- Authenticates the Institute Nodal Officer and verifies the application (`INSTITUTE_VERIFIED`).
- Authenticates the Department Nodal Officer and approves the application (`APPROVED`).
- Generates the official Sanction Order, triggering the PDF generator and Nodemailer dispatcher.
- Confirms the PDF exists in `server/uploads/sanctions/` with non-zero byte size.
- Verifies the `EmailLog` database document is created with `emailType: 'SANCTION_APPROVED'`, `sanctionNumber`, and recipient email.
- Executes the Admin Email Retry endpoint (`/api/admin/email-logs/:id/retry`) and confirms delivery audit updates (`retryCount: 1`).

```bash
cd server
node test_sanction_email_workflow.js
```

### 2. SLP Demo Mode & Auto-Escalation Suite (`test_slp_demo_flow.js`)
Validates the full SLP 1-minute demo SLA, auto-escalation, breach warnings, and resolution flow:
- Validates public SLP configuration endpoint (`DEMO` mode, 60s SLA).
- Registers a new student and submits an application, initiating the 60s SLA timer.
- Simulates a time-warp SLA breach (>60s) and triggers the background heartbeat engine.
- Verifies `slaStatus` changes to `SLA_BREACHED` without altering or skipping the `SUBMITTED` workflow stage.
- Verifies automatic Admin escalation notification generation and `SLP_SLA_BREACHED` audit logging.
- Performs Institute verification after breach, confirming historical recording as `COMPLETED_AFTER_SLA`.
- Verifies the next stage (`ROUTED_TO_DEPARTMENT`) initializes with a fresh SLA timer.
- Simulates Department scrutiny breach and validates subsequent Department approval & sanction generation.
- Queries the Admin SLP Monitor API (`/api/slp/admin/overview`) and verifies real-time KPI accuracy.

```bash
cd server
node test_slp_demo_flow.js
```

### 3. Strict 5-Stage Sequential Workflow Test (`test_workflow_sequence.js`)
Validates that an application transitions strictly through each queue and is visible only to the appropriate officer at each stage:
- Registers a new student and submits an application.
- Confirms visibility in the Institute queue and absence from the Department queue.
- Executes Institute Verification and validates promotion to the Department queue.
- Executes Department Approval.
- Executes Sanction Order generation and validates the generated Sanction Number.
- Executes DBT Disbursement and verifies bank UTR generation.

```bash
cd server
node test_workflow_sequence.js
```

### 4. Full End-to-End Test (`test_e2e_flow.js`)
Simulates the entire multi-user operational journey:
- Health check & database seeder verification.
- Student account registration & profile biodata completion.
- Application submission for active schemes.
- Institute Officer authentication & scrutiny approval.
- Department Officer authentication & sanction allocation.
- Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) batch processing.
- Payment ledger and audit trail verification.

```bash
cd server
node test_e2e_flow.js
```

### 5. Student-to-Institute Scrutiny Flow (`test_student_institute_flow.js`)
Focuses on registration, document checks, and institute officer defect/verification actions:
```bash
cd server
node test_student_institute_flow.js
```

## 🔒 Security & Architecture Highlights

- **Decoupled Micro-Frontend Architecture**: 4 isolated React portals eliminate role pollution and prevent client-side credential leaking.
- **Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Validated simultaneously at the Express JWT middleware layer (`middleware/auth.js`) and React client layer (`ProtectedRoute.js`) across 4 distinct roles: `STUDENT`, `INSTITUTE_OFFICER`, `DEPARTMENT_OFFICER`, and `ADMIN`.
- **Immutable Audit Logging**: Every critical action (submission, verification, sanctioning, disbursement, user updates) creates an immutable record in MongoDB with actor ID, role, action type, IP address, and timestamp.
- **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Integrity**: Strict pre-sanction verification of student bank account numbers, IFSC codes, and Tahsildar income certificates prevents duplicate disbursements or unauthorized grant allocation.
